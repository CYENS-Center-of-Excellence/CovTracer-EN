At EU-level, MoH has the role of the joint data controller together with the data controllers in other EU member states with regards to the cross-border interoperability with other national contact tracing mobile applications."

  "efgs_consent": "The data (i.e., diagnosis keys, test date, symptoms’ date) are transferred with a user’s consent to the joint controllers of other EU member states through the EFGS, which then forwards them without further processing to the official contact tracing apps provided by other EU Member States, so that the users of such apps across the EU can receive notification about possible exposure to COVID-19. The EFGS (European Federation Gateway Service) is a service operated by the EU member states, so that every European citizen may receive exposure notifications if he/she came in touch with any other European citizen. The implementing decision about the EFGS is available here: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32020D1023&from=EN. You have the right to withdraw any consent you granted the MoH in the App at any time with effect for the future. Please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before the withdrawal. To withdraw your consent to the Proximity Tracing feature, you can deactivate the “Exposure Detection” feature or delete the App. To withdraw your consent to the sharing of your random IDs in case of infection to COVID-19, you can go to “Settings” menu on the CovTracer App and then click on “Delete my data”, to have your data removed immediately from your phone. You can also delete the App.",
